 pract 1 Hypothesis Testing
 
A)t-test 

CODE:

"apple sold in a day are 97"
"H0:Number of apple sold is equal to 97"
"H1:Number of apple sold is not equal to 97"
"H0:mu-97"
"H1:not H0"
"One sample t test"
"csv:1 sample t test_apple"
apple<-read.csv(file.choose(),sep=",",header=T)
summary(apple)
t.test(apple$C1,alternative="less",mu=97)
"We will accept Ho because the p value is greater than 
0.05"



B)Independent t test

CODE:

"independent t test"
"The company is assessing the different in salary of males and females"
"H0: Average time is equal for 2 groups"
"H1: Not H0"
"csv:1 sample t test_malefemalesalary"
Salary<-read.csv(file.choose(),sep=",",header=T)
summary(Salary)
t.test(Salary$MALES,Salary$FEMALES, alternative="two.side", var.equal=TRUE)
"We will accept Ho because the p value is greater than 
0.05"

C)Paired t test for poverty level

CODE:

"Paried t test"
"A survey was done organized to check poverty level" 
"HO:Poverty is increased"
"H1:not H0"
"csv:paired_t_test_povertylevel"
poverty<-read.csv(file.choose(),sep=",",header = T) 
t.test(poverty$X1,poverty$X2,alternative = "greater", paired = T)
"We will accept Ho because the p value is greater than 0.05”


D)Paired t test

CODE:

"paired t test"
"MIS report:
HO: Average time is equal (before and after)
II1: average time (after) is less than"
time1<-read.csv(file.choose(),sep=",",header = T)
t.test(time1$time_before,time1$time_after, alternative = "less", paired = T)



E)t test for Correlation

CODE:

"t test for correlation"
"To study correlation between 'apptitude' and job_prof"
"H0:there is no correlation between scores and job proficiency(??—0)"
"H1: aptitude scores and job proficiency are correlated" 
cor<-read.csv(file.choose(),sep=",",header = T)
summary(cor)
cor.test(cor$aptitude,cor$job_prof,alternative = "two.sided",method = "pearson")



F)t test for Variance

CODE:

"t test for variance"
var<-read.csv(file.choose(),sep=",",header = T)
summary(var)
var.test(var$time_g1,var$time_g2,alternative = "two.sided")
